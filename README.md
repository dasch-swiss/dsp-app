> **_NOTE:_**  The current DSP-APP version presents the **admin view** only.

This app is a simple user interface for the Data and Service Center for the Humanities DaSCH, which uses the DSP-API/Knora server application in the backend. It's a system for annotation and linkage of resources in arts and humanities.

DSP-APP implements [DSP-JS-LIB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dasch-swiss/dsp-js) to connect with [DSP-API](https://docs.dasch.swiss/developers/knora/api-reference/). DSP-API is a software framework for storing, sharing, and working with primary resources and data in the humanities.

Additionaly it's built with [DSP-UI-LIB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dasch-swiss/dsp-ui) &mdash; reusable DSP specific Angular modules.

Please check our [DSP Release Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQe-0nFKqYHwHT3cNI2M_ZCycKOgDZBxtaabxEQDDkNKJf6funMVrJBJPgMFEJdiBdCesahUhURN6MS/pubhtml) to use this app with the correct and required versions of the dependent packages.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the resource files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Documentation / User guidelines

We built the user guidelines and developer documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) in a separate [repository](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-docs). The user guide is published on [docs.dasch.swiss/user-guide](https://docs.dasch.swiss/user-guide).

## Work on GitHub

### "main" branch

- use the branch "main" to work on the DSP-ADMIN app. Any changes should be created in branches from "main" and should be merged into the "main" branch.

### "develop" branch

- use the branch "develop" to work on the whole DSP-APP app (admin + research parts). Any new developments should be created in branches from "develop" and should be merged into the "develop" branch.

## Publish a new version to DockerHub

Before publishing:

- Update README if necessary and commit the changes.

- Be sure that all dependencies to DSP-UI-LIB, DSP-JS-LIB and DSP-API are set to the correct version.

A new version will be published with each Github release as it's part of Github actions' workflow. To make a new release, go to <https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-app/releases> and update the draft called "Next release" by changing:

- The tag version and the release title (same name) with the version number, e.g. `v3.0.0` or `v3.0.0-rc.0`
- If this is a pre-release, check the box "This is a pre-release"

New package will be available on <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/daschswiss/dsp-app>.
