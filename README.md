This app is a simple user interface for the Data and Service Center for the
Humanities DaSCH, which uses the Knora server application in the backend.

It's a system for annotation and linkage of sources in arts and humanities.

This project was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6 and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 10.13.0.

**Required version of Knora: ^[9.0.0](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v9.0.0)**

Developed by the [DaSCH Team](https://dasch.swiss) in Basel.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

`dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests
